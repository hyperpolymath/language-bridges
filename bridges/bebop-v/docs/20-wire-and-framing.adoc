= Wire and Framing

Bebop is a binary serialization format, but TCP is a byte stream. You must
frame messages so the receiver knows where one message ends and the next begins.

== Recommended Framing

=== Send

* `u32` little-endian payload length
* followed by `payload_length` bytes of Bebop payload

=== Receive

1. Read 4 bytes
2. Parse length (little-endian u32)
3. Read exactly `length` bytes
4. Pass payload bytes into `bebop_decode_*`

== Examples

See V examples in `v/iiot_server.v` and `v/iiot_client.v`.
