== Context-based Allocation (recommended)

All allocations for decoded objects are owned by a `BebopCtx*`.

* `bebop_ctx_new()` creates a context (arena/allocator)
* `bebop_decode_*()` populates output structs with pointers owned by the context
* `bebop_free_*()` releases per-object allocations where meaningful
* `bebop_ctx_reset()` clears the arena for reuse (high throughput IIoT)
* `bebop_ctx_free()` destroys the context

This avoids global state and supports one context per connection/thread.
